In the last few years I have started working with Python and have a moderate skill level with it.

Programs in this folder include:

- classify.py - Goes through each exploding star (aka supernova) observation (actually, a spectrum, i.e., a plot a brightness vs. wavelength) in the input directory. First checks to see if there is actual signal in the observation, or if the spectrum is just noise. If there *is* signal in the observation, the spectrum is run through the [SuperNova IDentification code](https://people.lam.fr/blondin.stephane/software/snid/) (Blondin, S. & Tonry, J. L. 2007. ApJ, 666, 1024), which is written in C++ and which I have contributed a small amount of content to. SNID is effectively an optimized cross-correlation code that compares the input spectrum with a set comparison template spectra. If SNID finds a "good" match between the templates and the input, then information regarding the observation and its SNID match(es) are written to a text file. Takes various optional inputs describing where the spectral data files are, what kind of files they are, and which set of SNID comparison templates should be used.

- fit_plat.py - Reads in a exploding star (aka supernova) light curves, which are simply the brightness measurements of a given supernova vs. time, stored in 3 column ASCII files: the first column is the date of the observation, the second column is the brightness measurement of the supernova on that date, and the third column is the uncertainty in the brightness measurement. It then plots one light curve at a time and the user clicks on 2 places on the plot. It then calculates the mean and maximum brightness between those 2 clicks. Lastly, the results for each supernova get written to a text file for later analysis and use.
