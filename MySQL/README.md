Part of my PhD thesis involved the creation and management of the UC Berkeley Filippenko Group's [SuperNovae DataBase (SNDB)](http://heracles.astro.berkeley.edu/oldsndb/) (deprecated Feb 2015). The SNDB uses the popular open-source software stack known as LAMP: the Linux operating system, the Apache web server, the MySQL relational database management system, and the PHP server-side scripting language. I have also implemented instances of a few PHP helper classes. See [this paper](http://mnras.oxfordjournals.org/content/425/3/1789.full.pdf) for more information regarding the SNDB. This folder includes a couple of scripts used to populate and manage the SNDB.

Scripts in this folder include:

something.sql - Does stuff.
